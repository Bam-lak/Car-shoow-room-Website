# Car-shoow-room-Website
The web-app I have developed is car show room and booking.

=> To make the system functional, you have to import the database from the database file (NB please use the name specified in the database) in mysql
=> The system has two independent logins i.e Admin and Customer
=> To enter to admin all you have to do is register first
=> To enter to the the admin you have to specify the location(localhost/car-showroom/Car_show_room_and_booking/admin/admin/adminlogin.php)
=> The username and password to login to the admin page is admin and admin respectively.
